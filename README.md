# Product-Analysis-Using-YouTube-Comments
About the project and basic Objective:
For the purpose of this project we have gathered tweets leveraging the Twitter API. We targeted three keywords - “iphonex”, “iphonexr” and “iphonexs” associated to three of the current popular mobile devices by Apple - iPhone X, iPhone XR and iPhone XS, respectively. Our intention with this project is to demonstrate how businesses can use a similar approach to gain insights about the perception of their product in the market.


About the code:
All the Jupyter notebook files are pretty self-explanatory.
